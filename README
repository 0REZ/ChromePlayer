* This is the source code of Chrome Player(renamed to Local Player)
* Chrome Player is an App for Google Chrome,
* available at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chkhjlbdflppmaddpjmjecgdagdljimc

-- Usage
A music player on your browser for LOCAL FILES.
Drag mp3/ogg files from file browser into the window.
Or, you can also add music files from a file dialog, which appears when you click the '+' button.
You'll find the file name show up.
And player above will automatically start to play the file.
If you double-click the file name in the file list, it'll start to play that file.

-- Motivation
Yet you can open and play (and pause, and so on) a mp3 file with Google Chrome, but only one file.
Chrome Player allows you to listen to multiple files without any annoying operation.

-- Key bindings
Press ? to see the keyboard shortcuts.
(For shortcuts, I didn't write some to the list,
which appears when ? pressed.
For example, you can also use Alt+Space to pause.
This was added because in Mac, Ctrl+Space is Spotlight.
And as for Mac users, Command key can be also used
where it is written as: <Ctrl>.)

-- Supported file types
mp3, ogg, aac, m4a

-- Not implemented features, unfixed bugs
Save the file list
Support for other types like wav or flac
Cost too much memory
Can't deal with large file ( > about 10MB )
( This 10MB is just a rough estimate. )
